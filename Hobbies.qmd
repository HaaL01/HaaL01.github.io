## Sport Climbing

Outside of technical projects, I spend most of my time pursuing Sport Climbing and bouldering as a fulfilling hobby to keep me active and healthy.

Sport climbing is an exhilarating form of rock climbing where climbers ascend pre-bolted routes using ropes and harnesses for protection. Requiring immense physical and mental strength, sport climbing tests climbers' technique, endurance, and problem-solving skills as they navigate challenging overhangs, crimps, and dynamic movements on vertical rock faces.

## Classical Guitar

I also enjoy practicing the classical guitar although I am not very good at it. I find it a relaxing activity.
