## A Summary of Conway's Game of life

An interesting study about chaotic systems and AI that I decided to recreate using Java and LibGDX.

Conway's Game of Life is a fascinating example of a simple set of rules that can give rise to complex and unpredictable behavior, highlighting the intricate connections between simple systems and chaos. Developed by mathematician John Conway in 1970, the Game of Life is a cellular automaton, a computational model that operates on a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The rules that govern the evolution of the Game of Life are deceptively simple: a living cell with two or three living neighbors survives to the next generation, a dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes alive, and all other cells either die or remain dead. Despite these straightforward rules, the Game of Life exhibits a remarkable range of behaviors, from stable patterns that remain unchanged indefinitely to oscillating patterns that cycle through a series of states, and even patterns that exhibit chaotic, unpredictable behavior.

The Game of Life's ability to produce complex and seemingly chaotic patterns from such simple rules has profound implications for our understanding of chaotic systems in general, and for the field of artificial intelligence in particular. It demonstrates that even relatively simple systems can exhibit highly complex and unpredictable behavior, a concept that is central to many areas of machine learning and AI. Neural networks, for instance, are built on the principle of combining simple computational units in intricate ways to produce complex and intelligent behavior. Furthermore, the Game of Life has been used as a testbed for exploring various algorithms and techniques in AI, such as genetic algorithms and cellular automata-based computing. By studying how patterns evolve and interact in the Game of Life, researchers can gain insights into the behavior of complex systems and develop new strategies for solving challenging problems. Overall, Conway's Game of Life serves as a powerful metaphor for the intricate relationships between simplicity and complexity, order and chaos, and the potential for complex and intelligent behavior to emerge from relatively simple systems.
