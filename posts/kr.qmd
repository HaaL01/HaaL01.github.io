Some where in 2021, I started getting interested in Linguistics. As part of this interest, I started learning Korean. It was a very interesting language to learn. And surprisingly, Korean is a very easy language to learn "TO READ". The specific grammars and sentences structures are very complex in contrast.

A simple resource to learn Korean is through the use of the following website: [Talk to me in Korean](https://www.talktomeinkorean.com/)
This website provides a very good resource to learn Korean. It provides a structured learning path for beginners to advanced learners.

Another resource that I found useful is the use of Anki. Anki is a flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to help you remember words and phrases. It is a very useful tool to help you remember vocabulary and grammar rules. It makes use of the concept of spaced repetition to help you remember words and phrases more effectively by showing you the flashcards at increasing intervals of time which helps you remember them better.

Refold is another resource that I found useful. Refold is a community of language learners who share their experiences and techniques for learning languages. They have a structured learning path that helps you learn languages more effectively. They also have a forum where you can ask questions and get help from other learners. The main idea behind Refold is in immersion and learning through context, rather than through traditional methods like memorization. This is a very effective way to learn languages as it helps you learn the language in a more natural way.

Along the way, I've learnt many techniques and pedagogies to learn not only languages better but also to build better understanding and retention of learning new skills and knowledge. Such as the use of spaced repetition, active recall and the use of mnemonics.

Lately however I haven't gotten the chance to continue learning Korean and I haven't been able to practice it as much as I would like. I believe that learning a new language is a very rewarding experience and it opens up new opportunities, friends and perspectives.
