Once upon a time, in the summer of 2021, I embarked on a journey to learn the Korean language. It was a beautiful sunny day when I decided to dive into the world of Korean culture and language.

I started by enrolling in an online language course that provided comprehensive lessons and interactive exercises. The course covered various aspects of the language, including vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and writing.

Every day, I dedicated a few hours to studying Korean. I practiced writing Hangul characters, the Korean alphabet, and learned basic phrases and greetings. I also listened to Korean music and watched Korean dramas to immerse myself in the language.

To reinforce my learning, I joined online language exchange communities where I could practice speaking with native Korean speakers. It was a great opportunity to apply what I had learned and improve my conversational skills.

As the summer progressed, I noticed significant progress in my Korean language skills. I could hold simple conversations, understand basic texts, and even write short paragraphs in Korean. It was incredibly rewarding to see my hard work paying off.

To further challenge myself, I decided to take a trip to South Korea at the end of the summer. It was an amazing experience to be surrounded by the language and culture I had been learning about. I had the opportunity to practice my Korean with locals, try authentic Korean cuisine, and explore the beautiful cities and landscapes.

Looking back, my summer of learning Korean was a transformative experience. It not only expanded my language skills but also opened doors to a new culture and perspective. I am grateful for the journey and the memories I made along the way.

And that's how my summer of 2021 was filled with the excitement and joy of learning the Korean language.
